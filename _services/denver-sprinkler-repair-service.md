Is your sprinkler system leaking underground?

Many reasons can lead to your sprinkler system leaking underground.  Sometimes a failing sprinkler valve can allow water to weep out and you'll see water still coming out of your sprinkler heads even after it has been turned off. Stopping your sprinkler system from leaking underground requires some investigation and an overall assessment often including the water pressure that your system is exposed to and the health of your underground sprinkler valves.

Repairing or replacing irrigation valves

There are many reasons why sprinkler valves begin to have problems such as debris clogging the diaphragm or other small orifices in the sprinkler valve itself.  The diaphragm may have become inflexible and be in need of replacement.  The solenoid may have become worn and/or ceased to operate sufficiently.  There may be worn or mis-aligned o-rings and seals within the sprinkler valve itself.  The valve itself may be loose or cracked, sprinkler solenoid may have been cross-threaded - the variations are endless.  The wiring or even the sprinkler controller may be at fault as they need to send sufficient current to each solenoid.

Locating buried sprinkler wires and valves.

You finally have a problem in that lost sprinkler valve box and need to find it so that a valve can be repaired.  Using the wires from the sprinkler timer, we can trace the wires underground to discover the location of your buried valve box and missing sprinkler valves.

In addition to locating the lost sprinkler valve box, we can trace the wires underground to find broken sprinkler wires and ground faults using our underground ground fault wire locator.  More often than not, the culprit is a contractor who dug in the yard and hit the wires with a shovel or a backhoe and made a shoddy underground wire repair which has now corroded and is no longer functional.  Regular wire nuts and electrical tape are not sufficient to prevent corrosion of copper wire splices underground.  The corrosion will eventually electrically separate the two wires hence, severing your connection.

Your sprinkler heads are not popping up.

Why aren't my sprinkler heads popping up you ask?  Usually, it's not because of a lack of the sprinkler valve not providing sufficient pressure.  The main reason why sprinkler heads do not pop up is that they have not been well maintained.  They are usually 1/2 to 1" underground and the constant action of the head rising up through grass and soil ends up pulling debris back down into the head itself.  This also scratches the sprinkler head shaft and allows for more sand and debris to enter via the tiny scratches which eventually fill up and bind the head altogether.  The initial stages of this problem present as heads that do not retract into the ground after the cycle has finished... later on these same heads will no longer come up without additional force because of the amount of grit binding them.  These sprinkler heads should be replace and raised to be at the height of the adjacent soil line.

Another sprinkler repair involves the overgrown grass and soil buildup which slowly buries the sprinkler heads.

Generally, the head needs to be excavated and if it isn't clogged with sediment, it can be elevated. It is best to go ahead and replace the sprinkler head with a new unit in order to ensure trouble-free operation for the next few years.
